Each time you guess a new animal is added to the tree
But, that animal may be more closely related to some animals on the tree than the others

Try and guess if any of the animals on the board belong in another more specefied group than click the group they belong to and see if you're right 



1. close all tabs initially- have them open as animals are added
2. add thumbanail image
3. make it so it'll update to closest cat- I thought I did that? 
4. investigate that major sorting bug- it's the  if (typeof node[ key ][ 0 ] === "undefined")- still not sure how to fix 
5. show animals details when you mouse over
6. get rid of arrows in animal wrapper
