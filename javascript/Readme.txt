1. i press guess I get an animal, that animal is added and the tree is updated
2. I guess and the animal appears in the right spot 
3. I press guess again and it gives me a new animal and adds it to the tree 


1. i need to press guess I get the racoon
adds it to animal but doesn't show 

1. I guess that the raccoon is an animal 
2. it draws a new animal for me - bear
3. add that animal the tree in mammalia but doens't show it 
4. the racoon is no longer the new animal so it shows up in mammalia 
5. ok obvi its a mammal so I click mammalia 
6. it draws me a new card 
7. this time its a carnivore, a tiger, 
8. it'll move bear and have it show up in carnivora 


ok. what would happen if i hit guess got a racoon
then hit animalia and then it saved what I clicked 
and ran a function that updated the tree //and rendered it 
and then it checked if animalia had that animal and gave me a point 

then I would hit a button and get an animal
